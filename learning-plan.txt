Great goal 👍 Dart + Flutter is a solid stack, and Dart can indeed be used on **both client and server**.

Below is a **progressive learning plan**, starting from the smallest possible full-stack example and gradually building up to a **document-sharing web application**.
Each stage has:

* 🎯 Goal
* 🧩 Client (Flutter Web)
* 🛠 Server (Dart backend)
* 📚 Concepts you should learn

I’ll assume:

* **Flutter Web** for the frontend
* **Dart Frog** (modern, simple) for the backend
  *(Shelf is another option, but Dart Frog is easier to start with)*

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites (Very Important)

### Learn Dart Basics

Before touching Flutter or servers:

* Variables, types
* Functions
* Classes
* async / await
* Futures & Streams
* JSON encoding/decoding

🎯 Outcome: You can write simple Dart programs and understand async code.

---

## Phase 1: Smallest Full-Stack App (Hello World)

### 1️⃣ Client-only: Button says Hello

#### 🎯 Goal

A Flutter Web page with a button that shows `"Hello"`.

#### 🧩 Client

* Flutter Web project
* One screen
* Button
* Text widget

#### 📚 Learn

* Flutter project structure
* StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget
* setState
* Widgets & layout basics

---

### 2️⃣ Server-only: Hello API

#### 🎯 Goal

A Dart server that returns `"Hello from server"`.

#### 🛠 Server

* Dart Frog project
* One GET endpoint: `/hello`
* Returns plain text or JSON

```json
{ "message": "Hello from server" }
```

#### 📚 Learn

* HTTP basics (GET, POST)
* Routes
* JSON responses
* Running a local server

---

### 3️⃣ Client → Server Communication

#### 🎯 Goal

Button click calls server → shows server response.

#### 🧩 Client

* On button press:

  * HTTP GET `/hello`
  * Display response

#### 🛠 Server

* Same `/hello` endpoint

#### 📚 Learn

* `http` package in Flutter
* async/await in UI
* Error handling (server down, timeout)

✅ **Milestone:** Full-stack app working end-to-end.

---

## Phase 2: Basic Interaction & State

### 4️⃣ Send Data to Server

#### 🎯 Goal

Client sends a name, server responds with a greeting.

Example:

```
Client sends: { "name": "Alex" }
Server responds: "Hello Alex"
```

#### 🧩 Client

* TextField
* Button
* POST request

#### 🛠 Server

* POST `/greet`
* Read JSON body
* Return response

#### 📚 Learn

* POST requests
* Request bodies
* JSON parsing
* Form inputs

---

### 5️⃣ Shared State (Simple Counter)

#### 🎯 Goal

Server stores a counter.
Each button press increments it.

#### 🧩 Client

* Button: "Increment"
* Shows value from server

#### 🛠 Server

* In-memory variable
* `/increment`
* `/value`

#### 📚 Learn

* Server-side state
* Stateless vs stateful servers
* Why memory storage is risky

---

## Phase 3: Real Persistence (Database)

### 6️⃣ Add a Database

#### 🎯 Goal

Persist data even if server restarts.

#### 🛠 Server

* SQLite or PostgreSQL
* Store:

  * users
  * counters / messages

#### 📚 Learn

* Database basics
* CRUD operations
* ORM or raw SQL
* Environment variables

---

## Phase 4: Authentication (Users)

### 7️⃣ User Registration & Login

#### 🎯 Goal

Users can sign up and log in.

#### 🧩 Client

* Signup page
* Login page
* Store auth token

#### 🛠 Server

* `/register`
* `/login`
* Password hashing
* JWT or session tokens

#### 📚 Learn

* Authentication vs authorization
* Password hashing (never plain text)
* Tokens & headers
* Protected routes

---

## Phase 5: File Uploads (Core Feature)

### 8️⃣ Upload Documents

#### 🎯 Goal

Logged-in user uploads a document.

#### 🧩 Client

* File picker
* Upload progress
* List of uploaded files

#### 🛠 Server

* Multipart file upload
* Save file to disk or cloud
* Store metadata in DB

#### 📚 Learn

* Multipart/form-data
* File handling
* Storage strategies
* File size limits

---

## Phase 6: Document Sharing

### 9️⃣ Share Documents with Another User

#### 🎯 Goal

User A shares a document with User B.

#### 🧩 Client

* User list
* Share button
* Permissions UI

#### 🛠 Server

* Document ownership
* Sharing table:

  ```
  document_id | shared_with_user_id
  ```
* Access control checks

#### 📚 Learn

* Authorization rules
* Access control lists (ACL)
* Many-to-many relationships

---

## Phase 7: Polishing to a Real App

### 🔟 Production Features

#### 🎯 Goal

Make it feel like a real application.

#### Add:

* Responsive UI
* Loading indicators
* Error messages
* Search documents
* Delete / revoke access
* Logs & monitoring

#### 📚 Learn

* Flutter web performance
* Pagination
* CORS
* Deployment (Docker, VPS, cloud)

## Final Architecture (What You’ll End Up With)

```
Flutter Web (Client)
  ├── Auth UI
  ├── File Upload UI
  ├── Share Management
  └── HTTP API Calls
        ↓
Dart Frog Server
  ├── Auth
  ├── File Upload
  ├── Permissions
  └── Database
        ↓
Database + File Storage
```

---

## Recommended Order to Start Practically

1. Dart basics
2. Flutter Web UI only
3. Dart Frog API only
4. Client ↔ Server
5. Auth
6. File upload
7. Sharing logic

If you want, next I can:

* 🧑‍🏫 Turn **Phase 1** into a **step-by-step tutorial**
* 📁 Design the **folder structure** for client & server
* 🧠 Explain **why Dart is good / bad for backend**
* 🛠 Suggest **tools & VS Code extensions**

Just tell me how deep you want to go next 🙂
